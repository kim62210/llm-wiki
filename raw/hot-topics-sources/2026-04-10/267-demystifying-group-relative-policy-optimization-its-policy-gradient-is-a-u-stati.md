Abstract:Group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a core methodological component of DeepSeekMath and DeepSeek-R1, has emerged as a cornerstone for scaling reasoning capabilities of large language models. Despite its widespread adoption and the proliferation of follow-up works, the theoretical properties of GRPO remain less studied. This paper provides a unified framework to understand GRPO through the lens of classical U-statistics. We demonstrate that the GRPO policy gradient is inherently a U-statistic, allowing us to characterize its mean squared error (MSE), derive the finite-sample error bound and asymptotic distribution of the suboptimality gap for its learned policy. Our findings reveal that GRPO is asymptotically equivalent to an oracle policy gradient algorithm -- one with access to a value function that quantifies the goodness of its learning policy at each training iteration -- and achieves asymptotically optimal performance within a broad class of policy gradient algorithms. Furthermore, we establish a universal scaling law that offers principled guidance for selecting the optimal group size. Empirical experiments further validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the optimal group size is universal, and verify the oracle property of GRPO.
