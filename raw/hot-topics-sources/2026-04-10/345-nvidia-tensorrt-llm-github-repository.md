TensorRT LLM Overview

TensorRT LLM is an open-sourced library for optimizing LLM and Visual Gen inference. It provides state-of-the-art optimizations, including custom kernels for common inference operations (attention, GEMMs, MoE, ...), algorithmic runtime optimizations (Prefill-Decode disaggregation, Wide Expert Parallelism, Speculative Decoding, etc), and much more, to perform inference efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs.

Architected on PyTorch, TensorRT LLM provides a high-level Python LLM API that supports a wide range of inference setups - from single-GPU to multi-GPU or multi-node deployments. It includes built-in support for various parallelism strategies and advanced features. The LLM API integrates seamlessly with the broader inference ecosystem, including NVIDIA Dynamo and the Triton Inference Server.

TensorRT LLM is designed to be modular and easy to modify. Its PyTorch-native architecture allows developers to experiment with the runtime or extend functionality. Several popular models are also pre-defined and can be customized using native PyTorch code, making it easy to adapt the system to specific needs.

Release Notes

Deprecation Policy

Deprecation is used to inform developers that some APIs and tools are no longer recommended for use. Beginning with version 1.0, TensorRT LLM has the following deprecation policy:

Communication of Deprecation

Deprecation notices are documented in the Release Notes.

Deprecated APIs, methods, classes, or parameters include a statement in the source code indicating when they were deprecated.

If used, deprecated methods, classes, or parameters issue runtime deprecation warnings.

Migration Period

TensorRT LLM provides a 3-month migration period after deprecation.

During this period, deprecated APIs, tools, or parameters continue to work but trigger warnings.

Scope of Deprecation

Full API/Method/Class Deprecation: The entire API/method/class is marked for removal.

Partial Deprecation: If only specific parameters of an API/method are deprecated (e.g., param1 in LLM.generate(param1, param2)), the method itself remains functional, but the deprecated parameters will be removed in a future release.

Removal After Migration Period

After the 3-month migration period ends, deprecated APIs, tools, or parameters are removed in a manner consistent with semantic versioning (major version changes may include breaking removals).

Telemetry Data Collection

TensorRT-LLM collects anonymous telemetry data by default. This data is used
in aggregate to understand usage patterns and prioritize engineering efforts.
This data cannot be traced back to any individual user. No prompts,
user-identifying information, or persistent identifiers are collected. Any
deployment identifiers are ephemeral, randomly generated per deployment, and
not linked to users. The data we collect includes:

Ingress point (e.g., LLM API, CLI, serve command)

Deployment duration (via periodic heartbeats)

GPU SKUs, count, memory, and CUDA version

Model architecture class name (e.g., 
LlamaForCausalLM
)

Parallelism configuration (TP/PP/CP/MoE-EP/MoE-TP sizes), quantization algorithm, dtype, KV cache dtype

System information (OS platform, Python version, CPU architecture, CPU count)

TRT-LLM version and backend

Feature flags (LoRA, speculative decoding, prefix caching, CUDA graphs, chunked context, data parallelism)

Disaggregated serving metadata (role and deployment ID)

Telemetry is automatically disabled in CI and test environments.

Opting Out of Telemetry Data Collection

To disable telemetry data collection, use any of the following methods:

Environment variable: Set 
TRTLLM_NO_USAGE_STATS=1
, 
DO_NOT_TRACK=1
, or 
TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true

File-based: Create the file 
~/.config/trtllm/do_not_track

Python API: Pass 
TelemetryConfig(disabled=True)
 to 
LLM()

CLI flag: Use 
--no-telemetry
 on 
trtllm-serve
, 
trtllm-bench
, or 
trtllm-eval

The telemetry collection code is fully open source and auditable at

tensorrt_llm/usage/
. For a detailed field-by-field
reference of exactly what is collected, see the
schema documentation.
