Introduction

In v0.11.0, the last code from vLLM V0 engine was removed, marking the complete migration to the improved V1 engine architecture. This achievement would not have been possible without vLLM’s community of 1,969 contributors, authoring over 950 commits in the past month (as of 12/18/25).

These efforts have been validated by vLLM’s inclusion in the SemiAnalysis open source InferenceMax performance benchmarks. In addition, vLLM is proud to be trusted in production by teams at Meta, LinkedIn, Red Hat, Mistral, and HuggingFace.

DeepSeek-style disaggregated serving and sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) model deployments remain state-of-the-art for high-performance LLM inference. This article outlines the key optimizations the vLLM team has built to push throughput even further, including:

Async scheduling

Dual-batch overlap

Disaggregated serving

CUDA graph mode 
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE

DeepGEMM enabled by default

DeepEP kernels integration

Expert parallel load balancing

SiLU kernel for DeepSeek-R1

For further reference, we recommend these excellent writeups by the llm-d, PyTorch, Dynamo, and Anyscale teams on large scale serving, disaggregated serving, distributed inference, and wide-EP using vLLM.

Results

Recent community benchmarks on a Coreweave H200 cluster connected using Infiniband with ConnectX-7 NICs now show a sustained throughput of 2.2k tokens/s per H200 GPU in production-like, multi-node deployments.

This marks a significant increase over earlier benchmarks, which showed ~1.5k tokens/s per GPU. This gain is a direct result of ongoing optimization work, including kernel improvements (silu-mul-quant fusion, Cutlass QKV kernels, TP attention bug fixes) and the implementation of Dual Batch Overlap (DBO) for decode.

This performance allows operators to realize immediate benefits by consolidating workloads and reducing the number of replicas needed for a target QPS, ultimately lowering token-per-dollar cost.

Key Components

Wide-EP

Deploying frontier models like the DeepSeek-V3 model family for large scale serving requires two major considerations:

Sparse expert activation: in DeepSeek-R1, only 37B of the model’s 671B total parameters are active with each forward pass

KV cache management: tensor parallel deployment is not optimal for DeepSeek’s multi-head latent attention (MLA) attention architecture, since latent projections are duplicated across shards

Expert parallelism (EP) is a deployment pattern that leverages these characteristics to maximize effective KV cache, and is supported in vLLM via the 
--enable-expert-parallel
 flag. In this pattern, a single set of experts are shared across ranks in the deployment. During a forward pass, tokens are routed between ranks to be processed by the appropriate expert.
Wide-EP token routing
Wide-EP combines EP with data parallelism (DP). Data parallel deployments can be launched with either the 
mp
 or 
ray
 data parallel backends, offering simpler setup within a Ray cluster. The benefit over tensor parallelism is shown in the following figure, which shows memory usage per GPU for DeepSeek-V3 using tensor parallel and expert parallel sharding strategies.

The TP strategy shows 34GB free device memory per H200, but for MLA models, each rank must duplicate latent attention projections. In a DP deployment, attention layers are duplicated so that latent projections are independent across ranks, increasing effective batch size across the deployment.

Increasing the expert parallelism degree increases synchronization overhead between ranks. To address this, vLLM has integrated support for the DeepEP high throughput and low latency all-to-all kernels. In addition, vLLM supports Perplexity MoE kernels and a NCCL-based AllGather-ReduceScatter all-to-all. See the vLLM MoE kernel docs for information on the all-to-all backends available in vLLM.
vLLM all-to-all backends
Dual-batch Overlap (DBO)

vLLM has integrated support for DeepSeek’s microbatching strategy as dual batch overlap (DBO), available via 
--enable-dbo
 flag from the command line. This strategy overlaps compute and collective communication to increase GPU utilization. In particular, vLLM implements this as follows:

A collective 
all_reduce
 across ranks to agree microbatching will be beneficial, with minimum threshold adjustable via 
--dbo-decode-token-threshold

The main thread creates microbatch worker threads, which complete CUDA graph capture

vLLM’s modular MoE all-to-all kernel base class coordinates microbatch worker launches, yielding control while waiting for GPU work to complete

Below is a profiling trace from a DeepSeek decode workload without DBO. The “MoE Dispatch/Combine” section shows the outsize duration spent in collective communication, despite the small compute load.
Before DBO
The following trace shows the same workload with DBO. The first microbatch worker thread initiates and completes MoE dispatch, then immediately yields to the second microbatch worker thread. Next, the second thread completes its own dispatch, yielding back to the first thread once it completes. Finally, the first worker completes its combine before yielding back to the second microbatch worker.

This results in higher GPU utilization in deployments where communication overhead is high, as is the case in deployments with high expert parallelism degree.
After DBO
Expert Parallel Load Balancing (EPLB)

MoE expert layers are optimized for balanced load across experts at train time, but at inference time, real workloads may cause imbalanced token routing. See NVIDIA’s experimental results on MoE expert routing for statistics on the difference in expert load balance between workloads.

In a wide-EP setup, this means some EP ranks could stay idle, while others process large batches of tokens. To alleviate this, vLLM implements the hierarchical and global load balancing policies from DeepSeek's expert parallel load balancer (EPLB). EPLB is controlled by the 
--enable-eplb
 CLI flag, with configurable window size, rebalance interval, redundant experts, and logging options.
EPLB in action
To implement EPLB, each MoE forward pass records per-token load, and a sliding window aggregates these statistics across EP ranks. When the rebalance interval is reached, the load balancer computes a new logical-to-physical expert mapping and orchestrates a weight shuffle so the new placement takes effect without restarting the model.

Disaggregated Serving

The disaggregated prefill/decode serving pattern, described by Hao AI Lab in the 2024 DistServe paper, is especially useful for expert parallel deployments.
P/D disaggregation in action
Since experts are distributed across ranks, a request's tokens starting on one rank may require processing by an expert on any other rank in the EP group. This requires synchronization between MoE layers (and dummy passes if a rank goes unused) so that layer combine collectives are ready to receive tokens at the appropriate time.

This means a single compute-bound prefill request can delay the forward pass of the entire EP group, amplifying the benefit of disaggregated serving. In addition, DeepSeek deployments can be configured to exclusively use the DeepEP kernel suited to their workload (high throughput vs. low latency).

Deployment Paths

llm-d

llm-d is a Kubernetes-native distributed inference serving stack providing well-lit paths for anyone to serve large generative AI models at scale. llm-d helps you achieve the fastest "time to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance" for key OSS models across most hardware accelerators and infrastructure providers. For more details, check out llm-d's Wide EP well lit path to replicate the results in this post.

Dynamo

Dynamo is designed for high throughput and low latency production deployments of LLMs. Features such as KV aware routing, KV Block Manager for cache offloading, and Planner for dynamic load matching enable you to hit tighter SLAs while scaling across more GPUs. vLLM and wide-EP serving is natively supported in Dynamo with all of these features. For more details check out Dynamo and the example recipe to replicate the performance in this blog post.

Ray Serve LLM

Building on Ray Serve primitives, Ray Serve LLM provides first-class serving patterns for prefill/decode disaggregation, data parallel attention and prefix cache-affinity request routing, focusing on modularity and ease of deployment on Ray clusters (including KubeRay on Kubernetes). A key differentiator is its seamless integration with the broader Ray ecosystem, including data processing and reinforcement learning (RL).

The framework integrates with NIXL and LMCache connectors for efficient KV transfer, and leverages Ray's distributed computing primitives to enable independent autoscaling of each phase based on load characteristics. Together, the solution provides a flexible and programmable layer for inference workloads that can be easily extended and composed to implement diverse serving patterns.

Roadmap

vLLM is continuously in improvement, with the following efforts currently in progress:

Elastic expert parallelism

Long context serving

KV cache transfer via CPU

Full determinism and batch invariance

Large MoE optimizations, e.g. op fusion for DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss models

Improve FlashInfer integration for latest kernels, e.g. SwapAB

Support independent TP sizes in disaggregated serving deployments

GB200 Optimizations for large scale serving

Summary

vLLM has fully migrated to the V1 engine, which demonstrates high throughput for DeepSeek-style MoE deployments and achieving 2.2k tok/s/H200 with wide-EP.

Wide-EP maximizes KV cache efficiency for MLA architectures, while dual-batch overlap and EPLB reduce communication bottlenecks and load imbalance.

Disaggregated prefill/decode further optimizes prefill and decode deployments for MoE workloads, with deployment options such as llm-d, Dynamo, and Ray Serve LLM.
