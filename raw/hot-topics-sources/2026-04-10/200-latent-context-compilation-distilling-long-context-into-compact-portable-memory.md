Abstract:Efficient long-context LLM deployment is stalled by a dichotomy between amortized compression, which struggles with out-of-distribution generalization, and Test-Time Training, which incurs prohibitive synthetic data costs and requires modifying model weights, creating stateful parameters that complicate concurrent serving. We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio.
