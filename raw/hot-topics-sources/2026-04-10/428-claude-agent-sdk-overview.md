Build production AI agents with Claude Code as a library

Copy page

The Claude Code SDK has been renamed to the Claude Agent SDK. If you’re migrating from the old SDK, see the Migration Guide.

Build AI agents that autonomously read files, run commands, search the web, edit code, and more. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptionsasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Find and fix the bug in auth.py", options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]), ): print(message) # Claude reads the file, finds the bug, edits itasyncio.run(main())

The Agent SDK includes built-in tools for reading files, running commands, and editing code, so your agent can start working immediately without you implementing tool execution. Dive into the quickstart or explore real agents built with the SDK:

Quickstart

Build a bug-fixing agent in minutes

Example agents

Email assistant, research agent, and more

​

Get started

1

Install the SDK

TypeScript

Python

npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk

pip install claude-agent-sdk

2

Set your API key

Get an API key from the Console, then set it as an environment variable:

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key

The SDK also supports authentication via third-party API providers:
Amazon Bedrock: set 
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
 environment variable and configure AWS credentials

Google Vertex AI: set 
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
 environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials

Microsoft Azure: set 
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1
 environment variable and configure Azure credentials
See the setup guides for Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Azure AI Foundry for details.

Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.

3

Run your first agent

This example creates an agent that lists files in your current directory using built-in tools.

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptionsasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="What files are in this directory?", options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Bash", "Glob"]), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Ready to build? Follow the Quickstart to create an agent that finds and fixes bugs in minutes.

Capabilities
Everything that makes Claude Code powerful is available in the SDK:

Built-in tools

Hooks

Subagents

MCP

Permissions

Sessions

Your agent can read files, run commands, and search codebases out of the box. Key tools include:

ToolWhat it doesReadRead any file in the working directoryWriteCreate new filesEditMake precise edits to existing filesBashRun terminal commands, scripts, git operationsGlobFind files by pattern (
**/*.ts
, 
src/**/*.py
)GrepSearch file contents with regexWebSearchSearch the web for current informationWebFetchFetch and parse web page contentAskUserQuestionAsk the user clarifying questions with multiple choice options

This example creates an agent that searches your codebase for TODO comments:

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptionsasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Find all TODO comments and create a summary", options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Run custom code at key points in the agent lifecycle. SDK hooks use callback functions to validate, log, block, or transform agent behavior.Available hooks:
PreToolUse
, 
PostToolUse
, 
Stop
, 
SessionStart
, 
SessionEnd
, 
UserPromptSubmit
, and more.This example logs all file changes to an audit file:

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom datetime import datetimefrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcherasync def log_file_change(input_data, tool_use_id, context): file_path = input_data.get("tool_input", {}).get("file_path", "unknown") with open("./audit.log", "a") as f: f.write(f"{datetime.now()}: modified {file_path}\n") return {}async def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Refactor utils.py to improve readability", options=ClaudeAgentOptions( permission_mode="acceptEdits", hooks={ "PostToolUse": [ HookMatcher(matcher="Edit|Write", hooks=[log_file_change]) ] }, ), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Spawn specialized agents to handle focused subtasks. Your main agent delegates work, and subagents report back with results.Define custom agents with specialized instructions. Include 
Agent
 in 
allowedTools
 since subagents are invoked via the Agent tool:

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AgentDefinitionasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Use the code-reviewer agent to review this codebase", options=ClaudeAgentOptions( allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Agent"], agents={ "code-reviewer": AgentDefinition( description="Expert code reviewer for quality and security reviews.", prompt="Analyze code quality and suggest improvements.", tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"], ) }, ), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Messages from within a subagent’s context include a 
parent_tool_use_id
 field, letting you track which messages belong to which subagent execution.Learn more about subagents →

Connect to external systems via the Model Context Protocol: databases, browsers, APIs, and hundreds more.This example connects the Playwright MCP server to give your agent browser automation capabilities:

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptionsasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Open example.com and describe what you see", options=ClaudeAgentOptions( mcp_servers={ "playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]} } ), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Learn more about MCP →

Control exactly which tools your agent can use. Allow safe operations, block dangerous ones, or require approval for sensitive actions.

For interactive approval prompts and the 
AskUserQuestion
 tool, see Handle approvals and user input.

This example creates a read-only agent that can analyze but not modify code. 
allowed_tools
 pre-approves 
Read
, 
Glob
, and 
Grep
.

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptionsasync def main(): async for message in query( prompt="Review this code for best practices", options=ClaudeAgentOptions( allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"], ), ): if hasattr(message, "result"): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Learn more about permissions →

Maintain context across multiple exchanges. Claude remembers files read, analysis done, and conversation history. Resume sessions later, or fork them to explore different approaches.This example captures the session ID from the first query, then resumes to continue with full context:

Python

TypeScript

import asynciofrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, SystemMessage, ResultMessageasync def main(): session_id = None # First query: capture the session ID async for message in query( prompt="Read the authentication module", options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob"]), ): if isinstance(message, SystemMessage) and message.subtype == "init": session_id = message.data["session_id"] # Resume with full context from the first query async for message in query( prompt="Now find all places that call it", # "it" = auth module options=ClaudeAgentOptions(resume=session_id), ): if isinstance(message, ResultMessage): print(message.result)asyncio.run(main())

Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools
The Claude Platform offers multiple ways to build with Claude. Here’s how the Agent SDK fits in:

Agent SDK vs Client SDK

Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI

The Anthropic Client SDK gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The Agent SDK gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.With the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:

Python

TypeScript

# Client SDK: You implement the tool loopresponse = client.messages.create(...)while response.stop_reason == "tool_use": result = your_tool_executor(response.tool_use) response = client.messages.create(tool_result=result, **params)# Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomouslyasync for message in query(prompt="Fix the bug in auth.py"): print(message)

Same capabilities, different interface:

Use caseBest choiceInteractive developmentCLICI/CD pipelinesSDKCustom applicationsSDKOne-off tasksCLIProduction automationSDK

Many teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production. Workflows translate directly between them.

Branding guidelines
For partners integrating the Claude Agent SDK, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:Allowed:
“Claude Agent” (preferred for dropdown menus)

“Claude” (when within a menu already labeled “Agents”)

” Powered by Claude” (if you have an existing agent name)
Not permitted:
“Claude Code” or “Claude Code Agent”

Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code
Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact the Anthropic sales team.

​

License and terms
Use of the Claude Agent SDK is governed by Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service, including when you use it to power products and services that you make available to your own customers and end users, except to the extent a specific component or dependency is covered by a different license as indicated in that component’s LICENSE file.
