Installation

💡 Using uv for Package Management: This project uses uv for fast and reliable Python package management. Install uv first: 
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
 (Unix/macOS) or 
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
 (Windows)

Note: You can also use pip if you prefer, but uv is recommended for better performance and more reliable dependency management.

📦 Offline Deployment: For offline or air-gapped environments, see the Offline Deployment Guide for instructions on pre-installing all dependencies and cache files.

Install LightRAG Server

The LightRAG Server is designed to provide Web UI and API support. The Web UI facilitates document indexing, knowledge graph exploration, and a simple RAG query interface. LightRAG Server also provide an Ollama compatible interfaces, aiming to emulate LightRAG as an Ollama chat model. This allows AI chat bot, such as Open WebUI, to access LightRAG easily.

Install from PyPI

### Install LightRAG Server as tool using uv (recommended)
uv tool install "lightrag-hku[api]"### Or using pip# python -m venv .venv# source .venv/bin/activate # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate# pip install "lightrag-hku[api]"### Build front-end artifactscd lightrag_webui
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build

# Setup env file# Obtain the env.example file by downloading it from the GitHub repository root# or by copying it from a local source checkout.
cp env.example .env # Update the .env with your LLM and embedding configurations# Launch the server
lightrag-server

Installation from Source

git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git
cd LightRAG

# Bootstrap the development environment (recommended)
make dev
source .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate# make dev installs the test toolchain plus the full offline stack# (API, storage backends, and provider integrations), then builds the frontend.# Run make env-base or copy env.example to .env before starting the server.# Equivalent manual steps with uv# Note: uv sync automatically creates a virtual environment in .venv/
uv sync --extra test --extra offline
source .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate### Or using pip with virtual environment# python -m venv .venv# source .venv/bin/activate # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate# pip install -e ".[test,offline]"# Build front-end artifactscd lightrag_webui
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
cd ..

# setup env file
make env-base # Or: cp env.example .env and update it manually# Launch API-WebUI server
lightrag-server

Launching the LightRAG Server with Docker Compose

git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git
cd LightRAG
cp env.example .env # Update the .env with your LLM and embedding configurations# modify LLM and Embedding settings in .env
docker compose up

Historical versions of LightRAG docker images can be found here: LightRAG Docker Images

Create .env File With Setup Tool

Instead of editing 
env.example
 by hand, use the interactive setup wizard to generate a configured 
.env
 and, when needed, 
docker-compose.final.yml
:

make env-base # Required first step: LLM, embedding, reranker
make env-storage # Optional: storage backends and database services
make env-server # Optional: server port, auth, and SSL
make env-base-rewrite # Optional: force-regenerate wizard-managed compose services
make env-storage-rewrite # Optional: force-regenerate wizard-managed compose services
make env-security-check # Optional: audit the current .env for security risks

For full description of every target see docs/InteractiveSetup.md.
The setup wizards update configuration only; run 
make env-security-check
 separately to audit the
current 
.env
 for security risks before deployment.
By default, rerunning the setup preserves unchanged wizard-managed compose service blocks; use a

*-rewrite
 target only when you need to rebuild those managed blocks from the bundled templates.

Install LightRAG Core

Install from source (Recommended)

cd LightRAG
# Note: uv sync automatically creates a virtual environment in .venv/
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate# Or: pip install -e .

Install from PyPI

uv pip install lightrag-hku
# Or: pip install lightrag-hku

Quick Start

LLM and Technology Stack Requirements for LightRAG

LightRAG's demands on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are significantly higher than those of traditional RAG, as it requires the LLM to perform entity-relationship extraction tasks from documents. Configuring appropriate Embedding and Reranker models is also crucial for improving query performance.

LLM Selection:

It is recommended to use an LLM with at least 32 billion parameters.

The context length should be at least 32KB, with 64KB being recommended.

It is not recommended to choose reasoning models during the document indexing stage.

During the query stage, it is recommended to choose models with stronger capabilities than those used in the indexing stage to achieve better query results.

Embedding Model:

A high-performance Embedding model is essential for RAG.

We recommend using mainstream multilingual Embedding models, such as: 
BAAI/bge-m3
 and 
text-embedding-3-large
.

Important Note: The Embedding model must be determined before document indexing, and the same model must be used during the document query phase. For certain storage solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL), the vector dimension must be defined upon initial table creation. Therefore, when changing embedding models, it is necessary to delete the existing vector-related tables and allow LightRAG to recreate them with the new dimensions.

Reranker Model Configuration:

Configuring a Reranker model can significantly enhance LightRAG's retrieval performance.

When a Reranker model is enabled, it is recommended to set the "mix mode" as the default query mode.

We recommend using mainstream Reranker models, such as: 
BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
 or models provided by services like Jina.

Quick Start for LightRAG Server

The LightRAG Server is designed to provide Web UI and API support. The LightRAG Server offers a comprehensive knowledge graph visualization feature. It supports various gravity layouts, node queries, subgraph filtering, and more. For more information about LightRAG Server, please refer to LightRAG Server.

Quick Start for LightRAG core

To get started with LightRAG core, refer to the sample codes available in the 
examples
 folder. Additionally, a video demo demonstration is provided to guide you through the local setup process. If you already possess an OpenAI API key, you can run the demo right away:

### you should run the demo code with project foldercd LightRAG
### provide your API-KEY for OpenAIexport OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your_opeai_key..."### download the demo document of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag/main/tests/mock_data.txt > ./book.txt
### run the demo code
python examples/lightrag_openai_demo.py

For a streaming response implementation example, please see 
examples/lightrag_openai_compatible_demo.py
. Prior to execution, ensure you modify the sample code's LLM and embedding configurations accordingly.

Note 1: When running the demo program, please be aware that different test scripts may use different embedding models. If you switch to a different embedding model, you must clear the data directory (
./dickens
); otherwise, the program may encounter errors. If you wish to retain the LLM cache, you can preserve the 
kv_store_llm_response_cache.json
 file while clearing the data directory.

Note 2: Only 
lightrag_openai_demo.py
 and 
lightrag_openai_compatible_demo.py
 are officially supported sample codes. Other sample files are community contributions that haven't undergone full testing and optimization.

Programming with LightRAG Core

For the complete Core API reference — including init parameters, 
QueryParam
, LLM/embedding provider examples (OpenAI, Ollama, Azure, Gemini, HuggingFace, LlamaIndex), reranker injection, insert operations, entity/relation management, and delete/merge — see docs/ProgramingWithCore.md.

⚠️If you would like to integrate LightRAG into your project, we recommend utilizing the REST API provided by the LightRAG Server. LightRAG Core is typically intended for embedded applications or for researchers who wish to conduct studies and evaluations.

Advanced Features

LightRAG provides additional capabilities including token usage tracking, knowledge graph data export, LLM cache management, Langfuse observability integration, and RAGAS-based evaluation. See docs/AdvancedFeatures.md.

Multimodal Document Processing (RAG-Anything Integration)

LightRAG integrates with RAG-Anything for end-to-end multimodal RAG across PDFs, Office documents, images, tables, and formulas. For setup and usage examples, see docs/AdvancedFeatures.md.

LightRAG Server will soon integrate RAG-Anything’s multimodal processing capabilities into its file processing pipeline. Stay tuned.

Replicating Findings in the Papper

LightRAG consistently outperforms NaiveRAG, RQ-RAG, HyDE, and GraphRAG across agriculture, computer science, legal, and mixed domains. For the full evaluation methodology, prompts, and reproduce steps, see docs/Reproduce.md.
